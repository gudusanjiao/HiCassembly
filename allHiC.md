## Preview
This pipeline is designed for using HiC sequencing data with nanopore assemblies attempting fetching relatively chromosomal level assemblies. Most of ideas refer to [ALLHiC Github](https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC/wiki).

The entire workflow for nanopore assembly, NGS data polishment, and HiC chromatin signal incorpration are shown below:
![Main Workflow](https://github.com/gudusanjiao/HiCassembly/blob/main/miscellaneous/Workflow.png "Workflow")
Steps below are a pipeline started from raw nanopore aseembly to reach chromosomal level assembly (Yellow box above). It works fine with *Salix nigra* now. There have been issues with *Salix exigua* which we are still working on it. 

## Step 1: Index raw nanopore assembly
This step take raw nanopore aseembly fasta file as input to create index file for both alignment and BAM file operations.
> When we call 'raw assembly' here, we refer to assembly using nanopore reads assembled by chosen aseemblers, and then polished by NextPolish using NGS read. Noted here, the 'raw assembly' is not 'raw', it is after 4 rounds of polishing. This term will be use for all following steps unless special mentions.

If your genome assembly is already indexed previously due to other analyzing process, you may skip this step.

`SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta` file is the raw assembly of *Salix nigra* stored under `./ref/`
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_index
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/01/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/01/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 1
#$ -P quanah

bwa index -a bwtsw ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta  
samtools faidx ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta
```
Output file will be `.bwt`, `.pac`, `.ann`, `.amb` files.

## Step 2: Align HiC reads to raw nanopore assembly
HiC reads are generated by sequencing DNA segments that potentially binds by chromatins. This step we will map all the HiC reads to raw assembly. Since we have multiple HiC returned file, we need to do mapping for each file separately.

`./HiC` is where we stored our HiC reads.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_rawAlign
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/02/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/02/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 36
#$ -P quanah

bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s1_R1.sai  
bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s1_R2.sai
bwa sampe ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta \ 
          SN_HiC_s1_R1.sai \ 
          SN_HiC_s1_R2.sai \ 
          ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz \
          ./HiC/SN527M_39.77G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s1.sam

bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s2_R1.sai
bwa aln -t 36 ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s2_R2.sai
bwa sampe ./ref/SN_flye1_nextpolish4.fasta \ 
          SN_HiC_s2_R1.sai SN_HiC_s2_R2.sai \ 
          ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R1.fastq.gz \ 
          ./HiC/SN527M_5.96G/HIC127_L2_1003876.R2.fastq.gz > SN_HiC_s2.sam
```
This step takes several hours to finish. Output file will be pair-end mapping `.sai` files and aligned read file `.sam`.

## Step 3: Filter alignment
This step will do 1) pre-filter reads without restriction enzyme sites 2) removing low-quality mapping hits 3) converting `.sam` file to `.bam` file.

`PreprocessSAMs.pl` requires a restriction enzyme name used during genome digestion before HiC sequencing. It is either MboI ![MboI](https://www.neb.com/-/media/catalog/cutsite-image-svg/r0147_mboi_cutsite.svg?rev=2acd76cf79284893b3ad2932f327ad5f&h=0&w=0&la=en&hash=E9602A500D7D6397CCAA394D6D53B415 "MboI"){height=20px width=50px} or HindIII ![HindIII](https://www.neb.com/-/media/catalog/cutsite-image-svg/r0104_hindiii_cutsite.svg?rev=be983da5f7fa41c1a25185c3ac6c7299&h=0&w=0&la=en&hash=A7ABB7690BAC6D8A6DBD4B8168363F1E "HindIII"){height=20px width=50px}. Before processing this step, you need to check the enzyme using for digesting genome by asking the sequencing company. `PreprocessSAMs.pl` will produce `.pos_of_GATC.txt`, `.near_GATC.500.bed`, `.REduced.bam`, `.REduced.paired_only.bam`, and `.REduced.paired_only.flagstat` files. Use the name of `.REduced.paired_only.bam` as the input for `filterBAM_forHiC.pl`

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#$ -V
#$ -cwd
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -N SN_allHiC_filter
#$ -q omni
#$ -l h_vmem=5.3G
#$ -o log/03/$JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID
#$ -e log/03/$JOB_NAME.e$JOB_ID
#$ -pe sm 36
#$ -P quanah
